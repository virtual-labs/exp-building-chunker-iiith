- **Tools**: Use online chunking tools and annotated corpora

#### 2. Chunking Complexity Analysis

**Activity**: Measure and compare chunking complexity

- **Task**: Count the number and types of chunks in sentences from English vs. Hindi
- **Learning Goal**: Quantify differences in phrase structure
- **Method**: Create a spreadsheet with chunk types and boundaries

#### 3. Historical Chunking Study

**Activity**: Trace changes in chunking patterns over time

- **Task**: Compare chunking in older vs. modern texts
- **Learning Goal**: Understand how syntactic chunking evolves
- **Resources**: Historical corpora and linguistic studies

#### 4. Computational Chunking Project

**Activity**: Build a simple chunker

- **Task**: Create a program that can identify and annotate chunks in sentences
- **Learning Goal**: Apply theoretical knowledge to practical implementation
- **Tools**: Python with NLTK or spaCy, or any programming language of choice
